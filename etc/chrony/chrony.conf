#           PPS
#               Driver for the kernel PPS (pulse per second) API. The parameter is the path to the PPS device (typically /dev/pps?). As PPS
#               refclocks do not supply full time, another time source (e.g. NTP server or non-PPS refclock) is needed to complete samples from
#               the PPS refclock. An alternative is to enable the local directive to allow synchronisation with some unknown but constant
#               offset. The driver supports the following option:
#
#               clear
#                   By default, the PPS refclock uses assert events (rising edge) for synchronisation. With this option, it will use clear
#                   events (falling edge) instead.
#
#               Examples:
#
#                   refclock PPS /dev/pps0 lock NMEA refid GPS
#                   refclock SHM 0 offset 0.5 delay 0.2 refid NMEA noselect
#                   refclock PPS /dev/pps1:clear refid GPS2
